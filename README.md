This is a place for alterhumans of all kinds to gather and get updated on what the community has to offer, like a news blog! The subjects stay consistent with everything to do with animals and nature and our community. For example, how to contribute to local nature reserves, therian meet-ups, beach clean-ups in your area, and animal conservation open days. But we also blow the whistle on things to look out for such as scammers, unethical fur sellers, raid alerts! and any other distressing matters that users should know to protect others and themselves <3

users will be able to hold their own account on the website, comment, rate other comments, have a bio, a theriotype/kintype badge, pick a colour role for their username and participate in polls and small on-site activites <3 

This website will be funded through donations and "advertising" but advertising is only accepted if it came from within the community for example; a streamer pays a certain amount to have a banner advertising they're twitch stream happening on wednesday "this will be a daily charge but their will be "1 week" "3 week" or "1 month" bundles to encourage longer advertising. another example would be an alterhuman has started selling their art prints this is also allowed and will be advertised in respective area's of the page the same daily charge or "bundles" apply here.  A third-party trying to advertise on our website for example "amazon black friday sale" is not allowed. This is completely irrelevant to the community and even if it did have some sort of relevancy jeff besoz is unreachable if one of our people get injured buying a product from them :) 

Everything that has been previously mentioned is only the beginning to what this website will host, future plans (far in the future but hopefully not too far) are;
